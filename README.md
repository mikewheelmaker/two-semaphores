# Two Semaphore Example
Two Semaphores Example Project in QtCreator using Qt 5 and C++.

This project is a very basic and simple example of what you can do using the Qt Framework and C++.

Very useful for teachers and students of C++ and QML, as it offers an easy and approachable first glimpse into the Qt Framework, which can appear very complex in the beginning.

Even though Qt is large and offers a lot of functionalities, the project scope is limited to only the bare minimum, focusing mostly on visuals with QML and some basic interaction with C++.

For a quick look, I have created [installers](https://github.com/mikewheelmaker/twosemaphoresexample/releases) for Windows, both for 32 and 64 bit architectures.

At the moment, there is no documentation or wiki available for this project, but the [Qt official documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.15/) and the [Qt forum](https://forum.qt.io/) are good as well.

The current maintainer and contributor for the project is [@mikewheelmaker](https://github.com/mikewheelmaker)
